# quant
This library generates a basic data structure for daily data for the SP500 / SZSE500 universes. 

Basic data handling is carried out in python. Data analysis and ML-modeling happen in R and are not provided here for now. Predictive models are stacked, including sector-based models, macro models and fairly hidden layers of predictions combined with reduced macro indicators. Horizons of 1-3 months. Sliding windows with variable lookback.

Thorough backtesting, 0 leaks. Reporting formatted as trade decision input. Decent running time for daily predictions.
